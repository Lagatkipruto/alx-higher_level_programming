How to Use 5-text_indentation.py
================================

This module defines a text-indentation function ``text_indentation(text)``.


Usage
=====

Text is printed with two new lines after each of the characters ``.``, ``?``,
and ``:``.


::

    >>> text_indentation = __import__('5-text_indentation').text_indentation
    >>> text_indentation("Hello?")
    Hello?
    <BLANKLINE>

No spaces are printed at the beginning of a line.

::

    >>> text_indentation("   Hello there.")
    Hello there.
    <BLANKLINE>

::

    >>> text_indentation("          ")

Similarly, no spaces are printed at the end of each printed line.

::

    >>> text_indentation("    Woah now.    This is messy.   ")
    Woah now.
    <BLANKLINE>
    This is messy.
    <BLANKLINE>

New lines are only printed for the characters ``.``, ``?``, and ``:`` -
text not ending with one of these characters is not ended with a new line.

::

    >>> text_indentation("No ending period, what bad grammar")
    No ending period, what bad grammar

New lines within a string are printed as normal.

::

    >>> text_indentation("Let's print a new-line! Here goes:\nPrinted.")
    Let's print a new-line! Here goes:
    <BLANKLINE>
    <BLANKLINE>
    Printed.
    <BLANKLINE>

::

    >>> text_indentation("\n\n\n We just printed three new lines.")
    <BLANKLINE>
    <BLANKLINE>
    <BLANKLINE>
    We just printed three new lines.
    <BLANKLINE>

Invalid Text
============

The paramter ``text`` must be a string. Otherwise, a TypeError is raised.


::

    >>> text_indentation(7)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: text must be a string

::

    >>> text_indentation({"one": 1, "two": 2})
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: text must be a string

::

    >>> text_indentation(None)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: text must be a string
